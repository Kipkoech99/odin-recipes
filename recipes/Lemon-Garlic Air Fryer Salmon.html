    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Less than 10 minutes is all it takes to achieve perfectly cooked salmon, thanks to your air fryer. When shopping, seek out center-cut filets about an inch thick and pick up a few sides to go along with this delicious main—perhaps a serving of okra like Allrecipes user Gammy Shark, or a simple risotto like Allrecipes user FrackFamily5.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) fillets center-cut salmon fillets with skin</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>3 thin slices lemon, cut in half</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine melted butter and minced garlic in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Rinse salmon fillets and dry with a paper towel. Brush with butter mixture and sprinkle with lemon-pepper seasoning and parsley.</li>
            <li>Spray the basket of the air fryer with cooking spray. Place salmon fillets in the basket, skin-side down, and top each with 3 lemon halves.</li>
            <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the air fryer and let rest for 2 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
